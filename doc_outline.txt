How structural elements are being used:

<header role="banner">
Contains the site identity as h1 “Comp 484” and page label as H2 “Structuring Pages”, plus the site navigation(<nav>). This works as the banner with navigation area at the top of the page.

<nav role="navigation"> (inside header/banner)
Holds a list of global links to index, syntax, structure, links, reference, and next. It’s the navigation between pages.

<main role="main">
Encapsulates the primary content of the page and contains the article section with several other sub-sections. It properly separates the central content from the header/navigation and footer.

<article>
Wraps a self-contained unit of content about the topic “Structuring Pages.” It has its own internal header with an H3 "Conveying meaning through structure" and a introductory paragraph, followed by several thematic section blocks each containg sub points.

<section> (used three times)
section off several sub-topics of page Structuring such as “Sectioning elements,” “Document outlines,” and “WAI-ARIA Roles.” Each has an H3 heading identifying what each section is about.

<aside role="complementary"> (inside the “Document outlines” section)
Provides supplementary content(“W3C Warning”) that supports but isn’t essential to the main narrative.

<footer role="contentinfo">
Contains site/contact details such as CSUN address and website link. It serves as the global footer.
